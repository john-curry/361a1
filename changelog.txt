Added changelog.txt
Fixed the HTTP header not being sent to the client
Added the server requiring http version 1.0
Added an index.html
Added the interactive client
Added README
Moved inludes, defines and function definitions to header files
Changed perform_http method to send uri to server instead of just the identifier so SimpClient now gets a 200 status from most websites
Added comments to header files
Moved parse_URI to header file because it is used in both the server and the client
Server accepts both full URI in header and it also accepts just the identifier
