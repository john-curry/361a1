Build:
  make

Client:
  You can run "make crun" to run a sample run of the client, which is the same
  as running ./SimpClient http://www.example.com:80/index.html. In General the
  client can be run as:

    ./SimpClient $URI

  There is also an interactive version of the client where you can enter uri's
  at a prompt. To start the interactive client:
    
    ./interactive_client


Server:
  As for the server you can run "make srun" which will start the server in the
  current directory on port 8000. In general the server can be run as:

    ./SimpServer $PORT $DIRECTORY

    ie: ./SimpServer 8080 .
